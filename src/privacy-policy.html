            partners and visitors to its Websites (as defined below)&nbsp;
            (“<strong>User</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”). We are
            committed to protecting the personal information that you share with
            us. We believe that you have a right to know how and why we collect
            your information and to know what measures we take to protect it.
            This Privacy Policy is intended on providing you with such
            information. We have taken efforts to make our Privacy Policy as
            clear and informative as possible and we encourage you to carefully
            read it. By accessing and/or using our Websites and Services you
            agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy Policy
            (the&nbsp;<strong>“Privacy Policy”</strong>), including to the
            collection and processing of your personal
            information.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Please note that this Privacy
            policy applies to the information provided by you through our
            websites that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the
            “<strong>Websites</strong>”), through our services/products or as
            you may otherwise interact with us (including, for example, by

              1.&nbsp;What information do we collect?
            </h3>
            We collect two types of data and information from our Users:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The first type of information is non-identifiable and anonymous
                information (“<strong>Non-Identifiable Information</strong
                >”).&nbsp;Non-Identifiable Information is any information that
                does not enable the identification of an individual. This kind
                of information is made available to us while you enter and/or
                use the Websites or the Services. Non-Identifiable information
                consists of technical information and behavioral information,
                and includes, among other things, the type of browser you use
                and the actions you take on the Websites or by using the
                Services, date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, clicked pages
                and any other information your browser may send us.
              </li>
              <li>
                The second type of information that is collected, either alone
                or in combination with other information, is information that
                could identify an individual (<strong
                  >“Personal Identifiable Information</strong
                >” or “<strong>PII</strong>”). PII may include your Internet
                Protocol Address, business contact details &#8211;first and
                last name, email or physical address, phone number, and cookies.
              </li>
            </ul>
            At all times, you may choose whether to provide or disclose PII. If
            you choose not to provide PII, you may still visit parts of the
            Websites or receive limited Services, but you may be unable to
            access certain options, programs, offers, and services that involve
            our interaction with you.
            <h3 class="text-capitalize pt-4" id="nr2">
              &nbsp;2.&nbsp;How your information is collected - and the lawful
              basis for that collection
            </h3>
            Non-Identifiable Information is collected when you access or use the
            Websites and/or the Services. We use industry standard tools and
            software to monitor your navigation and usage of the Websites and
            services, your usage pattern-logs and other communications data. We
            may also use “cookies” and Flash (or similar technologies), which
            stores certain information on your computer (“<strong
              >Local Storage</strong
            >”) and which allows us to enable automatic activation of certain
            features and improve your experience. It is easy to prohibit Local
            Storage, most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your
            hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before
            a cookie is stored. To erase or disable the Local Storage option in
            Flash you should use the settings option of Flash according to the
            specific instructions provided by the technology provider. However,
            if you block or erase cookies, or change the settings of Flash, your
            online experience may be limited. We also collect information that
            you provide us voluntarily, for example, we collect PII when you:
            <ul>
              <li>File an online form on one of our Websites</li>
              <li>Provide us with information at a live event</li>
              <li>Register for our services and making payments</li>
              <li>
                Post materials, participating in online forums or providing
                comments and feedback to online discussions on our Websites
              </li>
              <li>Contacting us by email</li>
              <li>Register (directly or indirectly) to any of our events</li>
              <li>In addition, we may receive your PII from your employer</li>
            </ul>
            Your personal data is stored by us on our servers and on the servers
            of various cloud-based database management services we engage,
            located in the United States and the European Union
            (“<strong>EU</strong>”). We will only collect and process personal
            data about you when we have a lawful basis to do so. Such basis
            includes&nbsp;your consent, a contract between us and you or a third
            party you are associated with, as well as other legitimate interests
            (for example:our compliant with applicable law, protecting the
            security of ours and our customers’ systems and data, and enable our
            services).
            <h3 class="text-capitalize pt-4" id="nr3">
              3. How we use the information collected?
            </h3>
            We collect each type of information for different purposes.
            Non-Identifiable Information is collected to allow enhancement of
            your experience on the Websites and Services, for statistical and
            research purposes and for customization and improvement of our
            various interfaces. It also helps us learn about the preferences of
            our users and general trends relating to the Websites and Services.
            PII is collected to:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Enable use of the Services. For example, in order to register to
                the Services you will need to provide us with your name and
                email so we will be able to issue a license key.
              </li>
              <li>
                Allow us to contact you (in accordance with applicable law) with
                proposals and tailored information regarding new products,
                events, offers, services, features, enhancements, special
                offers, upgrade opportunities, and events of interest. For
                example, when you fill out a request for a quote, we will need
                you to provide us with contact details.
              </li>
              <li>Provide you with technical assistance and support.</li>
              <li>

                our services
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-capitalize pt-4" id="nr4">
              4. How can you control your information?
            </h3>
            JFrog may retain your information for a period consistent with the
            original purpose of collection. For example, we will retain your
            information for as long as you are using our services, and for a
            reasonable period thereafter. Aggregated and/or anonymous data, and
            any other Non-personal Information may remain on our servers
            indefinitely all as permitted under the applicable privacy laws. You
            may request to review, correct, delete or otherwise modify any of
            the PII that was provided to us, or request to confirm whether we
            process your personal information. In addition, you may object to
            our processing of your PII for a legitimate interest. Kindly send an
            email to
            <a href="mailto:Compliance@jfrog.com">PII@jfrog.com</a>in
            connection with the aforementioned issues and we will provide you
            with all required information. Please note that you may manage the
            receipt of marketing and non-transactional information from us by

              5. Sharing information with third parties
            </h3>
            Our Websites and some of the Services allow you to share information
            with other users and create and publish content. Any content that
            you post on or via the Websites (“<strong>User Submissions</strong
            >”) may be publicly available to other users. The notices and tools
            that we provide on the Websites are intended to inform you which
            information will be made publicly available. If you publish your
            personal information in any User Submissions, you may receive
            unsolicited messages from other users of the Websites or the public.
            We, therefore, encourage you only to post information that you are
            sure you want to be accessible to anyone. If you are using our
            services on behalf of an organization or if you provide us with an
            email address which belongs to an organization, certain information
            provided to us may be accessible to the respective administrator or
            to other users of such organization. JFrog uses third-party service
            providers to enable us to provide the Services. These providers are
            not permitted to store, retain, or use information collected by us
            except for the sole purpose of providing us with the Services on our
            behalf. JFrog uses commercially reasonable efforts to engage with
            third parties that post a privacy policy governing their collection,
            processing and use of non-personal and personal information. Our
            third party service providers include, without limitation:

JFrog provides this statement to those residents (&#8220;you&#8221;) in accordance with requirements under the CCPA to make certain disclosures about the collection and processing of their Personal Information.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This PRIVACY NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS applies solely to JFrog, visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California (“consumers” or “you”) when you visit the JFrog Websites or subscribe to receive the any of JFrog software or services (collectively, our “Services”). Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this notice.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>We Do Not Sell Your Personal Information</strong></p>
            <p>Under the CCPA, a business that sells California residents&#8217; Personal Information to others:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>must give notice to California residents before selling their Personal Information to others; and 2. must provide the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>JFrog does not sell Personal Information, including Personal Information of anyone under 16 years old. Thus, these notification and opt-out requirements do not apply to JFrog.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Your Rights Under the CCPA</strong></p>
            <p>The CCPA provides California residents with certain rights related to their Personal Information. To submit a request based on these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:Compliance@jfrog.com">privacy@jfrog.com</a></p>
            <p>When receiving a request, we will verify that the individual making the request is the resident to whom the Personal Information subject to the request pertains. Only you, or a person that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a request related to your Personal Information. Verifying your request will require you to provide sufficient information for us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information, or a person authorized to act on your behalf (e.g., previous transactions of person to whom request relates).</p>
            <p>Please note that we may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on a request if such request is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.</p>
            <p>With respect to their Personal Information, California residents may exercise the following rights:</p>
            <p><strong>Right to Know and Access.</strong> You may submit a verifiable request for information regarding the: (1) categories of Personal Information collected or disclosed by us; (2) purposes for which categories of Personal Information are collected by us; (3) categories of sources from which we collect Personal Information; (4) categories of parties with whom we share that Personal Information with; and (5) specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you during the past twelve months (also called a data portability request). You may only make such requests twice (2) per every twelve (12) months.</p>
            <p><strong>Right to know whether your Personal Information is sold or disclosed for a business purpose and to whom. </strong>California residents have the right to request from a business that sells or discloses Personal Information for a business purpose separate lists of the categories of Personal Information collected, sold or disclosed for a business purpose in the preceding 12 months, including the categories of third parties to whom the Personal Information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose.</p>
            <p><strong>Right to say no to the sale of your Personal Information. </strong>As explained above, the CCPA requires businesses that sell Personal Information to allow residents the ability to opt out of the selling of their information.</p>
            <p>Again, JFrog does not sell Personal Information.</p>
            <p><strong>Right to non-discrimination of service or price if you exercise your privacy right. </strong>The CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against a California resident for exercising any of their rights under the CCPA, including by</p>
            <ul>
            <li>denying goods or services</li>
            <li>charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or by imposing penalties</li>
            <li>providing a different level or quality of goods or services</li>
            <li>suggesting that the person exercising their rights will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Right to Delete</strong>. California residents have the right to request that a business delete any of their Personal Information that the business collected from them, subject to certain exceptions. Please note that a record of your deletion request may be kept pursuant to our legal obligations.</p>
            <p><strong>Response Timing and Format</strong>. We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.  If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to the email address associated with that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide may only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons why we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will endeavor to select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
            <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
            <p><strong>Submit Requests</strong>. To exercise your rights under the CCPA, you can:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Email us at <a href="mailto:Compliance@jfrog.com">privacy@jfrog.com</a>; or</li>
